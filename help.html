<h2>
<a name="attaching-the-device-to-a-bell"></a>Attaching the device to a bell</h2>
<P>(Safety first - all bells must be down before entering the bell chamber.)</p>
<P>The Bell-Boy is designed to be magnetically mounted on the side of the headstock in line with the gudgeon pins.  There are two metal washers inside the base of the Bell-Boy which are attracted to a magnet attached to the headstock.</p>
<P>If you have metal headstocks in your tower, affixing the magnet to the headstock is a simple matter of clipping it on (but be careful, the magnets are strong and fragile).  If you have a wooden headstock, then you can either screw the magnet on (they have a countersunk hole for this purpose), or if you are not comfortable with placing screwholes in your headstock, you can glue the magnet on (I have successfully used hot melt glue).</p>   
<P>Note that I put non-slip tape on each side of the magnet to help prevent the Bell-Boy slipping once it is affixed.</p>
<P>The magnet can be placed on either side of the headstock (the software detects which orientation it is in and adjusts automatically).  To affix the Bell-Boy to the headstock, position it with the label towards you and the LED down and clip it onto the magnet.  See the pictures below.  Do not mount the Bell-Boy at an angle but don't worry about placing it absolutely square, just accurate by sight will be sufficient.</p>
<p><img src="Mounting.png" alt="Where to mount the Bell-Boy"></p>
<P>Once affixed onto the headstock, power on the device (press the button on the top for 2-3 seconds until the LED lights) and you can then leave the bell chamber.</p>
<h2>
<a name="connecting-your-computer"></a>Connecting your computer</h2>
<P>Back in the ringing chamber, start up your computer or tablet.  Go to the wifi settings and connect to the Bell-Boy wifi network.  Accept any security warnings (the network does not have a passphrase associated with it so is completely open).</p>
<P>Once connected to the network, open a browser window and in the address bar type 10.0.0.1 (or http://10.0.0.1) and the home page should appear after a few seconds.  Here is what it should look like and details of the various areas of the screen and the various controls.</p>
<p><img src="MainScreenGuide.png" alt="Main Screen Guide"></p>
<P>Notes:</p>
<P>(1) Wifi has limited range.  The Bell-Boy seems to work fine when separated from the bell chamber by about five metres or so.  I have not tried anything more than this.  Towers can, however, have much greater distances between ringer and bell so I would like some feedback as to range experienced by users.  If necessary, I can easily provide code and instructions to build a portable wifi repeater with a very sensitive receiver that can be mounted closer to the bell (the spider seems to be a good place for this...)</p>
<P>(2) You will need a computer/tablet with a browser that is newer than (about) 2012 (it does not matter how old the computer or tablet is as long as it has or has been updated to broswer version released after this date).  The crucial elements are that the browser should support Javascript, HTML5 and websockets.   All mainstream browsers will do so but I know that there are some modern speciality browsers that won't.  The software running on the Bell-Boy device has been extensively tested on Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Edge and the last version of Internet Explorer. If the page does not appear in full, it is possible that your computer may have Javascript disabled (quite common on some work tablets and many mobile phones).  See if you can try to enable Javascript in your device's settings menu.</p>
<P>(3) Some tablets scale the image to fit the display in a way that software does not understand.  If you see the display not looking aligned to the left and right, just tap the settings icon (the pink cog at the bottom of the screen) and that should reset things.</p>
<h2>
<a name="a-calibration-session"></a>A calibration session</h2>
<P>The Bell-Boy will need to be calibrated each time it is attached to a bell or fully powered off.  The calibration process is simply allowing the bell to rest in the down position for about 20 seconds and then raising the bell pretty much normally. </p>
<P>Once your browser has connected to the Bell-Boy device, look at the messages at the bottom of the screen.  It will ask you to keep the bell down and at rest.  This is the first stage of calibration - the bell should be stable (not rocking and please don't touch the ropes).  When that message changes prompts you to raise the bell, that's exactly what you should do!  You might not see it if you are raising the bell but once the bell is high enough, the message will change to indicate that it is now taking calibration readings and will ask you to continue to raise the bell and set it normally.  About 20 seconds after the bell is set, the calibration messages should disappear and the Bell-Boy is ready to use.</p>
<P>The calibration values will be retained for all future ringing sessions until the device is fully powered off.</p>
<P>The Bell-Boy assumes that all recordings start with the bell at stand at handstroke.  It will get terribly confused if you ring the bell up with a recording running or if you start a recording at stand at backstroke.  It won't break anything, you just won't get good results.</p>
<h2>
<a name="recording-a-session"></a>Recording a session</h2>
<P>With the bell at stand, press/click the record icon.  Type an appropriate filename in the box that appears and then click the "Start Recording" button.</p>
<P>You should see the status line at the bottom of the screen start counting.  If you see an error complaining about the bell not being at stand or moving, try again.  If the bell really is at stand and the device thinks it isn't let me know (it is possible that there are some very unusual bells out there with strange angles for standing the bell).</p>
<P>Once you see the status line counting, the ringer can start ringing.</p>
<P>There is a live view of what is happening on the bell.  Have a look at this screen:</p>
<p><img src="Playback.png" alt="Recording session"></p>
<P>The bell in the middle of the main part of the screen is animated and shows the live position of the bell.  Just under the bell are two numbers, one preceded by "H" and the other by "B".  These are the timings of the handstroke and backstroke halves of each stroke in seconds.  See the <a href="#comparing-strokes">Comparing strokes</a> section later which describes the main usefulness of this facility.</p> 
<P>Once the session has finished press the stop button.  (It is easier if the session finishes with the bell at stand, just as it normally would).  The device then does some calculations on the session and the status line should report on the number of strokes found.  In these calculations, there are some assumptions made about how bells behave.  These should be sensible assumptions but if you regularly see something like "Funny swing found" then let me know.  Note that the device will work if you record a ringing down session but it will get a bit confused so don't expect it to properly count the number of strokes.</P>
<P>Notes:
<P>(1) If you choose a filename that already exists on the device then the old file will be silently overwritten (i.e. without warning).
<P>(2) There are some forbidden characters for filenames and if you try to start a recording with any of these characters a warning will appear.  
<P>(3) I commonly use date, bell number, ringer and method for filename so it will be something like "2202-1-Peter-BobDoubles" but you can use anything you like.  There will be a lot of recordings on the device so some consistency might be useful.
<h2>
<a name="loading-saved-sessions"></a>Downloading saved sessions</h2>
<P>Every session you record will be saved.  It will either be saved using the file name you give when starting the recording or (if no file name was provided) it will be given a "unnamed" filename with the date and time appended.
<P>To download a previously recorded session, press the cloud download button, select it from the pop up box that appears and then press open.
<p><img src="FileDownload.png" alt="File Screen Guide"></p>
<P>The status bar at the bottom of the screen will start counting the samples that it has loaded and when it has stopped the number of full strokes found will be displayed (much as for a recorded session).</P>
<P>Notes:</P>
<P>(1) Downloaded sessions will have calibration applied to them (as per when they were recorded) automatically after they have been downloaded.
<P>(2) It is possible to delete the recorded sessions or to upload sessions recorded on another Bell-Boy but this can not be done through the web interface and is instead done over "Windows Explorer" or another file browser with equivalent CIFS functionality.  To do this go to (say) windows explorer and type \\10.0.0.1\ in the location bar.  You should then see the relevant folder with the bell recordings in it.  If you are asked to enter a user name, type "root" and that should do the trick.  See the <a href="#downloading-files">Downloading files</a> section for more details.
<h2>
<a name="playback-a-session"></a>Playback a session</h2>
<p>With a session loaded it can be played back.  Just press the play control.  You can pause the session during playback by pressing the pause control.  Press the pause control again to resume playback.</p>
<p>The playback speed can be adjusted. See the <a href="#settings">settings</a> section below.</p>
<h2>
<a name="skipping-through-a-session"></a>Skipping through a session</h2>
<P>One a session has been recorded (see above) or loaded (see directly above), it can be analysed stroke by stroke.</P>
<P>With a session loaded, press/click either of the skip forward or skip back buttons.  You should see a display like this:</P>
<p><img src="StrokeByStroke.png" alt="Strokes"></p>
<P>The number in the middle of the main part of the display is the stroke number (one being the first stroke in the session).  The "H" and "B" numbers beneath this are the timings for the handstroke and backstroke halves of the stroke.</P>
<P>The stave section of the display shows a number of half and full strokes.  Each stroke has two bars associated with it. The bar with the small line to the left shows the handstroke and the bar with the small line to the right shows the backstroke. The height of each bar is a representation of the work done on the pull (the stronger and longer the pull the taller the bar). The vertical position of the centre of the bar shows the timing (the first red line above and below the white line represents a timing of one beat - below the white line showing a fast change and above the white line a slow change. The peal rate is the centre white line (but this needs to be configured/set see the timing section below).  The internal shading of the bar shows the maximum height reached by the bell - a half shaded bar (no matter its height) shows the bell has reached top dead centre.</P>
<P>Note that in order to present the most useful information there is an interaction with the pull strength parts of the display and the stroke timings.  I have defined each stroke as starting when the bell starts falling at handstroke.  The first stroke of any session, therefore, will have nothing in the handstroke check section of the display (the bell starts at stand).  Each stroke has four components which are (in order) handstroke pull, backstroke check, backstroke pull and handstroke check.</P>
<P>Because ringers are used to feeling the handstroke check and handstroke pull as all part of the same thing (it is just a pull on the rope managing the rise of the bell and its subsequent falling), these are next to each other on the display. The possibly confusing bit is that when, say, stroke two of a session is being displayed (number "2" in the middle), the handstroke check on the leftmost side of the screen is the end of stroke 1 (remember the stroke starts at the start of handstroke pull).  Looked at another way the four main sections of the screen will show the handstroke check part of stroke 1 and the handstroke pull, backstroke check and backstroke pull sections of stroke 2.</P>
<P>The stroke timings on the stave section, are shown with respect to the immediately preceding pull.  So the bar for, say, the handstroke part of stroke 30 shows the pull strength for the preceding pull at handstroke and the timings for the chime following that pull.</P>
<h2>
<a name="comparing-strokes"></a>Comparing strokes</h2>
<P>The most important part of the Bell-Boy's software is the ability to compare sessions.  This works by overlaying the readings from one session onto another.  The overlaid session appears in yellow on the top part of the display and on the stave part as a narrower bar outlined in yellow.</P>
<P>A typical usage would be to either record a new session of a method or load a previously recorded session of a method, place it on the overlay and then record a ringer playing the same method.  See this picture:</P>
<p><img src="StrokeComparison.png" alt="Stroke comparison"></p>
<P>Of course, a method in a particular ringing session may not start at the same time as in another session in which the method is being rung.  The band could be settling down in rounds longer before the method is called.  This means that there should be a way of aligning the two sessions.  This is done using the pink skip selection control.</P>
<P>This control has three settings main only (white), overlay only (yellow) and both (white and yellow).  The setting chosen here affects what the skip forward and skip backward controls do.</P>
<P>Let's try this.</P>
<P>Record a new session on the bell or load a previously recorded session.  Then press either of the skip forward or skip backward buttons to show a particular stroke.  Then press the yellow heart control.  You will see the yellow overlay appear.  This will be directly on top of the main (white) display, so you won't see any difference between the two strokes.  Now press the skip forward button again, the main (white) display should move forward a stroke but the yellow (overlaid) display should stay as it was.  You can keep track of which strokes are displayed using the numbers in the centre of the main display or the numbers below the centre bars on the stave (there are white and yellow numbers for the main and overlaid sessions).</P>
<P>Press the skip selection control (it should change from having a white "eye" to a yellow "eye").  Press the skip forward button again.  The main display should be where it was and the yellow overlay should change.</P>
<P>Press the skip selection control (it should change to have a white and yellow "eyes") and press the skip backward control.  Both main (white) and overlay (yellow) strokes should change.</P>
<P>Press the skip selection control again and it will change back to just having a white "eye".</P>
<P>Note that you can also navigate by clicking the stave.  This behaves the same way as skip forward and skip back in that it observes the setting of the skip selection control to determine whether the main (white) or overlay (yellow) moves.  It is possible to navigate a session much more quickly this way.</P>
<P>The general usage for this functionality is to load a session, push it onto the overlay, record or load another session and then compare the two stroke by stroke by first arranging the two sessions so that the relevant method starts are aligned (it might be stroke 6 for one session and stroke 8 for the other - it just depends on when the method start is called).</P>
<h2>
<a name="downloading-files"></a>Downloading files</h2>
<P>If the Bell-Boy is on and you are connected to its wifi network, you can download session recordings from Windows explorer (or using CIFS on Linux).  Just navigate to \\\\10.0.0.1\ and you will see a Bell Samples directory within which are the various recordings.  If you are asked to enter a user name, type "root" and that should do the trick.  Note that some security protocols for network shares on Windows were recently deprecated so let me know if this does not work for you.  Also note that it is possible for anyone to delete recordings from here (this may be wanted or unwanted)! </P>
<h2>
<a name="settings"></a>Settings</h2>
<h4>Deskside usage</h4>
<P>The top line enables you to use the Bell-Boy as a deskside playback device (i.e. not attached to a bell).  Normally the device expects to be attached to the bell and will put bottom-of-screen messages nagging you to hold the bell at rest and then to raise the bell (as if it was going through its initial calibration exercise).  Clicking the "Playback only" button switches off these messages and disables the ability to record sessions.  If you click it accidentally when the Bell-Boy is attached to a bell, you can just click it again to get back to normal "on-bell" mode.</P>
<h4>Bell rise</h4>
<P>Some ringers have a problem with letting the bell rise high enough, particularly at backstroke.  The target angles setting will put green lines on the display giving the ringer something to aim at.</P>
<h4>Angles</h4>
<P>The angles section here selects the range of bell angles to display on the screen.</P>
<h4>Playback speed</h4>
The playback speed alters the speed of playback(!).</P>
<h4>Scale</h4>
The scale control decides the full scale range of the main display.  200 works well enough but others may be better.  The number is acceleration in degrees per second per second.</P>
<h4>Timings</h4>
<P>To get the most easily interpretable display in the stave section, the Bell-Boy will need to know roughly how the band's timings are working.  There are three elements to the timings, the peal time (expressed as changes per minute or CPM), the number of bells and how much of an open handstroke there is at handstroke lead.  Once the number of bells and the CPM rate has been selected, the Bell-Boy then knows how much time there should be to each "beat" (i.e. how much a ringer should slow down or speed up when moving up or back) and sets the stave of the display so that the red lines closest to the centre white line represents one beat.</P>
<p><img src="Timings.png" alt="Timings"></p>
<P>Bands vary greatly as to how much of a open handstroke they allow.  So this is configurable.  It is expressed as a factor of a "beat" (so 1.0 is a one beat open handstroke, 0.5 is half a beat and 0.0 is no open handstroke).</P>
<P>To change the timings click the Timings button.  This will only work if a session is currently loaded.  A new window will open towards the top of the screen.  Change the settings there to suit.  There is also an "Auto" button.  This makes an estimate of what the peal time and the open handstroke factor should be (but you should have the correct number of bells selected first).  Once the auto button has been clicked the calculated numbers will appear in a pop-up window and you can choose whether or not to apply them.</P>
<P>The auto button is only an estimate and will not always get things perfectly correct each time.  What I do is use the button to get close and then manually adjust the timings (the display changes each time you make an adjustment so you can see what you are doing).</P>
<P>If you are using the Bell-Boy to train a single ringer ringing alone, I find it best to set the number of bells at 6, the CPM to 31 and the open handstroke factor to 0.0.  You may prefer other settings and you can always adjust them after recording a session if you like.</P>
<h4>Chime simulation</h4>
<P>The Bell-Boy needs the vibration of a strike in order to signal that a strike has happened.  I am aware that some people might like to try the Bell-Boy with tied clappers.  If you want to do this, you can set the Bell-Boy to simulate chimes by setting a time (in milliseconds) after bottom dead centre to simulate a chime.  Where to set this is up to you (as it varies from bell to bell but 300ms is a common value - you can also use the time reported by the diagnostics display below.</P>
<P>One thing I have not tried is to see if the Bell-Boy still works with muffled (or half-muffled) clappers.</P>
<h4>Demo</h4>
<P>This is just a bit of eye-candy really.  It can be switched on at any time (by clicking the "Start demo" button) including when the bell is being rung.  Its main purpose is to show how the device responds to movement.</P>
<P>Note that the Bell-Boy has no absolute reference for yaw.  It will assume that the direction that the logo is pointing in (if the device is placed on a table with the LED visible and closest to the table) is "North" and all other yaw positions (i.e. moving the Bell-Boy in a circle without lifting it off the table) will be relative to that.</P>
<p><img src="EyeCandy.png" alt="Eye candy"></p>
<h4>Diagnostics</h4>
<P>The Bell-Boy can display some diagnostics (by clicking the "Diagnostics" button).  A ringing session should be loaded first.  The display shows (in the graph) the acceleration profile of the bell after gravity has been adjusted for).  I will update this section with some more information as to how to interpret this display at a later date.</P>
<P>The handstroke and backstroke checkboxes enable one or both of the handstroke and backstrokes parts of the ringing session.</P>
<p>The gravity adjustment number is what the Bell-Boy thinks the effect of gravity is on the bell.  It is expressed as acceleration in degrees per second squared at the point when the bell is at 90 degrees to the ground.  It is just an internal number and you don't need to think about it too much.</p>
<P>The implied timings shows what would be applied by the "Auto" button if automatically calculating the peal time and open handstroke factor.</P>
<P>The average strike angles row shows where the bell is when a strike was recorded.  They are normally around 60 degrees (backstroke chime) and 300 degrees (handstroke chime) but this varied by bell weight (and other things) if the two numbers don't add up to 360 then there might be some odd-struckness.  In a similar vein, the average strike times from BDC shows the time (in ms) from bottom dead centre when a strike is recorded.</P>
<p><img src="Diagnostics.png" alt="Diagnostics"></p>
<h4>Sleep mode</h4>
<P>As the usage time of the Bell-Boy is limited by its battery (about 6 hours), I have implemented a sleep mode.  This is triggered from the settings display and you should select the number of hours that you want the device to sleep.  This might be useful if you go to lunch on a training day or if you want to make recordings for a session in the morning (eg morning mass) and also in the evening (eg evensong).  After sleep has stated you will see the Bell-Boy's wifi network disappear, it will reappear when the device wakes.</P>
<P>The calibration settings are preserved during sleep so you can leave the bell up during sleep.</P>
<P>Whilst in sleep mode the device will only be woken up after the selected sleep time has elapsed.  If the battery runs low during sleep, the device will go into a full power off (and will not wake).</P>
<P>During sleep mode the LED will flash red once every 8 seconds or so.  If you want to cancel sleep mode, you can only do so by pressing the power button on the Bell-Boy for 20 seconds or so.  When sleep mode is cancelled the LED will rapidly flash red and then go into full power off.</P>
<P>Sleep mode will also be cancelled if the device is plugged in to charge.  It will then go into a normal charge cycle. </P>
<P>Sleep mode uses about 10% of the remaining battery life every 8 hours or so (depending on battery capacity).</P>
<h2>
<a name="shutdown"></a>Shutdown</h2>
<P>You can shutdown the Bell-Boy in two ways.  The first is by holding the power button on the front of the device down for a couple of seconds until you see the LED flash (and the device should then shutdown within the next 30 seconds).  The second is to select the power control in the web interface and then press OK in the resulting pop-up.</P>
<h2>
<a name="power-and-battery"></a>Power and battery</h2>
<P>Your Bell-Boy has an internal LiPo battery, which is good for around 6 hours of powered on use from a full charge (you will get much more if you send the device to sleep).  It is important not to overdischarge LiPo batteries so the device will switch off if the battery level gets too low.</P>
<P>The battery can be charged via the micro USB port (both ports seem to work, but best to use the official one which is the one closer to the side of the case).  You should use a standard 5V (no more than 5.2V) USB charger.  The charge current is set at around 250mA, so you can even charge the Bell-Boy using a computer USB port.  Once plugged in, the LED will go solid red, when the charge cycle is complete (about 4 hours from a drained battery), the LED will go solid green.  You can then unplug the power lead from the micro USB port.  Within a few seconds of unplugging, the LED will quickly flash red a few times and then go off (this indicates that the Bell-Boy is completely powered off).</P>
<P>The Bell-Boy is purposely designed not to be used whilst power is connected via USB.  When power is connected in this way, the Raspberry Pi is held in a halt state and won't boot.  So don't attempt to get a longer usage time out of the Bell-Boy by leaving it attached to a bell with power connected - it won't work!</P>
<h2>
<a name="updating-the-software-on-your-bell-boy"></a></a>Updating the software on your Bell-Boy</h2>
<P>The software on the Bell-Boy can be updated.  All that's needed is a way to connect the Bell-Boy's SD card to a computer connected to the internet.  Download the latest version of the software from the update folder ([here](https://github.com/BBUK/Bell-Boy/tree/master/updates)  ), the file is called update.tar.gz and put it onto the SD card.  Don't interfere with any of the other files you might see on the card.</P>
<P>Plug the card into your Bell-Boy (ensuring it has a battery good for at least 10 minutes or so) and power it on.  After a few minutes the Bell-Boy will power off automatically.  Your software has been updated and you can now use it normally.</P>
