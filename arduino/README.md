## bellboy

This contains an Arduino-style sketch that runs on the ATmega on the Bell-Boy PCB.  The LowPower library is required. 

## BBCalib

A little Arduino sketch that moves servos on my auto calibration deck.

## HotPlate

An Arduino sketch that controls my homebrew soldering hot plate.  It uses a DOGM LCD I had lying around and the PID library.
